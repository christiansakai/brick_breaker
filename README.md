# Brick Breaker

Small game project using [phaser](http://phaser.io/) by following the tutorial from [Developing an HTML5 Brick-Breaker Game With Phaser](https://www.amazon.com/Developing-HTML5-Brick-breaker-Game-Phaser-ebook/dp/B00XYQC2WQ). Code is slightly different from the actual tutorial.

Needs static file server to run this game.
